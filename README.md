# indel-gene-analysis
These codes can used for generating properties of indels.
1)"chr_slide_window.pl" can caculated gene density, expression level, GC content, and other character of genome in a slide window and steps as you like.
2)"findsequece.pl" can help print sequence of any gene or reads as you like.
3)"Indel_change_ORF.pl" can help you find the really changes of indel to the ORF of a gene.
4)"Indel_change_ORF_translate.pl" can help to translate the changes of ORF from nucletide to amino acid.
5)"IndelDomain.pl" can help to find the indel located on domain or nodomain region.
6)"length.pl" can caculate the length of any DNA or amino acid sequence.
